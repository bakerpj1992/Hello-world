# Hello-world
An introductory run-through of Github infastructure. The content may or may not have much meaning at this point.
I am an extremely ameteur software engineer. I moreso think it is important for anyone that considers themselves competitive to have  working knowledge of the basics of the latest software. For this reason I want to become sufficiently knowledgable about a handful of languages. This is a multi-year endeavor, but it will be worth it in the end!
